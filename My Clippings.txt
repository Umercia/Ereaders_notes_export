Get a pack of post-it notes and create three columns: To-Do, Doing and Done. Write down each of your tasks on a post-it note and put them all under the To-Do column. Each day, take the most important item from the To-Do column and move it to Doing while you work on it. When the job is complete, move it to Done and repeat the process.

Our personal experience is that a detailed day-to-day itinerary approach works well for trips of up to a month. Above that duration, we focus less on working out day-to-day routes and more on sketching out destinations in blocks of a few days, weeks or months at a time.  BIG-PICTURE PLANNING FOR LONGER TRIPS If we were going to cycle from say London to Beijing, we would plan it roughly as outlined below. Note that the detailed planning would only initially be done for the first section, and then towards the end of each section for the following leg of the journey. Break the trip into a few sections. In this example, leg number one might be from London to Istanbul, then Istanbul to Tashkent, Tashkent to Kashgar and Kashgar to Beijing.  Gather general information on each section.

Paper also has a special quality that makes it easier to pick out small but crucial aspects of a region. Many studies have shown that people comprehend more when they read on paper versus a screen (especially where very detailed texts are concerned). Perhaps this is why we instinctively feel that paper maps are superior when it comes to spotting landmarks, potential routes and landscape features such as steep hills and forests on a map.

During the trip itself, a paper map is the easiest way to explain our trip to others. Some of the best memories of our cycling trips come from evenings when we gathered around a table with a bunch of other cyclists, spread out all our maps, opened a bottle of wine and started talking. We couldn’t achieve the same atmosphere by comparing GPS tracks.

Digital maps, by contrast, are like the brushstrokes that make up the painting. They give access to a level of precise navigation that would be nearly impossible to achieve with paper maps. That level of detail is why we fold up our paper maps and turn exclusively to our GPS once we start cycling for the day. Thanks to our GPS, we get turn-by-turn directions and a plethora of interesting statistics such as how far we’ve cycled, our expected time of arrival at the next major town or how many hours of light left in the day.  When we enter a city, digital maps are a lifesaver.

For navigation, however, it’s best to purchase maps with a scale between 1:200,000-1:500,000. There are some exceptions to this rule. We’ve planned trips across Kazakhstan and Cuba on maps with a scale of 1:1,000,000. In Europe this would be a disaster because such a map would only show the highways but in some countries there aren’t many roads to choose from and traffic levels are low compared to the developed world. A highly detailed map is therefore less critical.

This becomes critically important in countries that don’t use the Latin alphabet because it will allow you to compare the Mandarin, Thai or Arabic letters on the road sign with the ones on your map.

How far do you expect to go per day? 2. How fast do you cycle? 3. What is your daily budget? 4. Should we stay in hotels, campsites or try to wild camp for free? 5. How often do you want to take a rest day? 6. What time of the day do you like to get started? 7. If the weather turns nasty, do we ride through the storm or seek shelter and shorten the tour? 8. Do you want to cook meals together or apart? 9. What excites you about touring, and what do you think the most challenging part will be? 10. What would your ideal day on the road be like?

Putting more weight in front takes some pressure off your back wheel (lowering the risk of broken spokes) and can make the bike feel more stable when going up a steep hill. However, because your back panniers are bigger it’s sometimes easier to put more weight in back. Often the difference in handling isn’t really noticeable.

Vivie suggested that cyclists should: 1. Keep stops short and few, to maintain your rhythm. 2. Eat light and frequent meals: eat before you are hungry and drink before you are thirsty. 3. Never push yourself to the point where you are too tired to eat or sleep. 4. Cover yourself before you become cold. Remove clothing before you become too hot and try to protect your skin from too much exposure. 5. Avoid wine, meat and tobacco, at least while cycling. 6. Pace yourself, especially during the early part of your ride when it is tempting to go faster because you have lots of energy.

We like to wait until we see a family or a couple somewhere outside and accessible, such as in front of their house or sitting at a cafe. We’ll stop, introduce ourselves and ask for something we don’t really need like a bit of water or directions. They ask questions about our trip. We chat for a while and then – just before we pedal off – we’ll ask: “Do you know anywhere we could put up a tent?” It’s a technique we learned from Ken Kifer, who points out the importance of the words used to make the request.

Bribes & Inflated Prices. Doing your research is the best way to cope with inflated prices. By knowing the correct price – or at least the approximate going rate – you can bargain confidently and walk away when the price is extortionate. Similarly, always ask the price of something before you commit to buying it and be wary of people who make a point of calling you ‘my friend’.

Similarly, always ask the price of something before you commit to buying it and be wary of people who make a point of calling you ‘my friend’. This is often the lead-up to an outrageous request. If it’s an official transaction, asking for a receipt is a quick way of clarifying if the fee you’re being asked for is a bribe or an actual charge. As you are bargaining, stay patient and remember that negotiating over prices is part of the culture in many countries. It may take anything from a couple minutes for a market purchase to a few hours if you’re trying not to pay an extra charge for a visa at the border.

“One of the most valuable things I’ve gained from this trip is a sense of confidence and self-assurance. Those days I spent alone in the Rockies – and my days spent crossing Nebraska – have left me with a profound sense of self-reliance and capability that no amount of self-help books or gym sessions could ever match. I learned to be brave. I learned to take risks, real risks, tangible risks, not the wishy-washy risks of everyday life. As a result of those experiences and successes, I feel entirely capable of taking care of myself. I did it. I’m awesome.” — Diana Johnson

If you’re reading this from the comfort of home, consider getting some practice in before disaster strikes. Have a bike mechanic show you how to build a wheel from scratch using new materials. Maybe you can even build your own touring wheels, under the supervision of an experienced mechanic. A short course in wheel building or truing will be invaluable, should you need to perform an emergency roadside repair.

Sleeping mats and heat sources don’t go together, particularly inflatable mats. Never leave your mat near a campfire. You don’t want a spark to fly onto the mat and burn a hole in the material. Another danger is heat inside the tent. If you’re taking a rest day, make sure you open all the air valves on your air mattress before going sightseeing. Otherwise the air inside the mattress may expand so much that it slowly tears the mat apart from the inside.

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It’s not just in some of us; it’s in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.

TACKLING THE TO-DO LIST Impressively long (and daunting) to-do lists can mount up as you prepare for a bike tour. How do you keep all those tasks under control and make sure everything gets done? One clever way is to take a tip from the world of IT and the frequently used ‘Scrum’ method of project management.  First, find some spare space on a white board, wall, mirror or even the back of a door. Get a pack of post-it notes and create three columns: To-Do, Doing and Done. Write down each of your tasks on a post-it note and put them all under the To-Do column. Each day, take the most important item from the To-Do column and move it to Doing while you work on it. When the job is complete, move it to Done and repeat the process.

The liking bias is startlingly simple to understand and yet we continually fall prey to it. It means this: The more we like someone, the more inclined we are to buy from or help that person. Still, the question remains: What does “likable” even mean? According to research, we see people as pleasant, if (a) they are outwardly attractive, (b) they are similar to us in terms of origin, personality, or interests, and (c) they like us.

Psychology professor Irving Janis has studied many fiascoes. He concluded that they share the following pattern: Members of a close-knit group cultivate team spirit by (unconsciously) building illusions. One of these fantasies is a belief in invincibility: “If both our leader [in this case, Kennedy] and the group are confident that the plan will work, then luck will be on our side.” Next comes the illusion of unanimity: If the others are of the same opinion, any dissenting view must be wrong. No one wants to be the naysayer that destroys team unity. Finally, each person is happy to be part of the group. Expressing reservations could mean exclusion from it. In our evolutionary past, such banishment guaranteed death; hence our strong urge to remain in the group’s favor.

Mark is a thin man from Germany with glasses who likes to listen to Mozart. Which is more likely? That (a) Mark is a truck driver or (b) he is a professor of literature in Frankfurt. Most will bet on B, which is wrong. Germany has ten thousand times more truck drivers than Frankfurt has literature professors. Therefore, it is more likely that Mark is a truck driver. So what just happened? The detailed description enticed us to overlook the statistical reality. Scientists call this fallacy base-rate neglect: a disregard of fundamental distribution levels.

So, no wonder we fear loss more than we value gain. Losing $100 costs you a greater amount of happiness than the delight you would feel if I gave you $100. In fact, it has been proven that, emotionally, a loss “weighs” about twice that of a similar gain. Social scientists call this loss aversion. For this reason, if you want to convince someone about something, don’t focus on the advantages; instead highlight how it helps them dodge the disadvantages.

Success that comes about through risky dealings is, to a rational mind, of less worth than success achieved the “boring” way (for example, with laborious work as a lawyer, a dentist, a ski instructor, a pilot, a hairdresser, or a consultant). Yes, looking at alternative paths from the outside is a difficult task, looking at them from the inside an almost impossible task.

He can resolve this conflict in one of three ways: (a) by somehow getting at the grapes, (b) by admitting that his skills are insufficient, or (c) by reinterpreting what happened retrospectively. The last option is an example of cognitive dissonance, or, rather, its resolution.

In conclusion: Though instantaneous reward is incredibly tempting, hyperbolic discounting is still a flaw. The more power we gain over our impulses, the better we can avoid this trap. The less power we have over our impulses—for example, when we are under the influence of alcohol—the more susceptible we are. Viewed from the other side: If you sell consumer products, give customers the option of getting their hands on the items right away. Some people will be willing to pay extra just so they don’t have to wait. Amazon makes a bundle from this: A healthy chunk of the next-day delivery surcharge goes directly into its coffers.

someone asks why you have yet to complete a task, it’s best to say: “Because I haven’t got around to it yet.” It’s a pathetic excuse (had you done so, the conversation wouldn’t be taking place), but it usually does the trick without the need to scramble for more plausible reasons.

In conclusion: Verbal expression is the mirror of the mind. Clear thoughts become clear statements, whereas ambiguous ideas transform into vacant ramblings. The trouble is that, in many cases, we lack very lucid thoughts. The world is complicated, and it takes a great deal of mental effort to understand even one facet of the whole. Until you experience such an epiphany, it’s better to heed Mark Twain: “If you have nothing to say, say nothing.” Simplicity is the zenith of a long, arduous journey, not the starting point.

This effect is called “stage migration” or the Will Rogers phenomenon, named after an American comedian from Oklahoma. He is said to have joked that Oklahomans who pack up and move to California raise both states’ average IQ. Since we rarely recognize such scenarios, let’s drill the Will Rogers phenomenon to anchor it in your memory. One good example is an auto franchise. Let’s say you take charge of two small branches in the same town with a total of six salesmen: numbers 1, 2, and 3 in branch A, and numbers 4, 5, and 6 in branch B. On average, salesman number 1 sells one car per week, salesman number 2 sells two cars per week, and so on up to top salesman number 6, who shifts six cars each week. With a little calculation, you know that branch A sells two cars per salesman, whereas branch B is far ahead with an average of five cars per salesman per week. You decide to transfer salesman number 4 to branch A. What happens? Its average sales increase to 2.5 units per person. And branch B? It now consists of only two salesmen, numbers 5 and 6. Its average sales increase to 5.5 per person. Such switcheroo strategies don’t change anything overall, but they create an impressive illusion.

And since Mark’s Harley cost him so many hours—and also nearly his wife—he prizes the bike so highly that he will never sell it. Effort justification is a special case of “cognitive dissonance.” To have a hole punched in your chest for a simple merit badge borders on the absurd. John’s brain compensates for this imbalance by overvaluing the pin, hyping it up from something mundane to something semisacred. All of this happens unconsciously and is difficult to prevent.

Groups use effort justification to bind members to them—for example, through initiation rites. Gangs and fraternities initiate new members by forcing them to withstand nauseating or vicious tests.

A mild form of effort justification is the so-called IKEA effect. Furniture that we assemble ourselves seems more valuable than any expensive designer piece. The same goes for hand-knitted socks. To throw away a handcrafted pair, even if they are tatty and outdated, is hard to do. Managers who put weeks of hard work into a strategy proposal will be incapable of appraising it objectively. Designers, copywriters, product developers, or any other professionals who brood over their creations are similarly guilty of this.

Suppose you read the following story in the newspaper: “Start-ups employ smarter people. A study commissioned by the National Institute of Unnecessary Research has calculated the average IQ in American companies. The result: Start-ups hire MENSA material.” What is your first reaction? Hopefully a raised eyebrow. This is a perfect example of the law of small numbers. Start-ups tend to employ fewer people. Therefore the average IQs will fluctuate much more than those of large corporations, giving small (and new) businesses the highest and lowest scores. The National Institute’s study has zero significance. It simply confirms the laws of chance. So, watch out when you hear remarkable statistics about any small entities: businesses, households, cities, data centers, anthills, parishes, schools, and so on. What is being peddled as an astounding finding is, in fact, a humdrum consequence of random distribution.

But how do we react to personal expectations? This brings us to the “placebo effect”—pills and therapies that are unlikely to improve health, but do so anyway. The “placebo effect” has been registered in one-third of all patients. But how it works is not well understood.

Accordingly Alzheimer’s patients cannot benefit from it: Their condition impairs the area of the brain that deals with expectations.

Expectations are intangible, but their effect is quite real. They have the power to change reality. Can we deprogram them? Is it possible to live a life free from expectations? Unfortunately not. But you can deal with them more cautiously. Raise expectations for yourself and for the people you love. This increases motivation. At the same time, lower expectations for things you cannot control—for example, the stock market. As paradoxical as it sounds: The best way to shield yourself from nasty surprises is to anticipate them.

In our evolutionary past, whoever thought too long and hard vanished inside a predator’s jaws. We are the descendants of quick decision makers, and we rely on mental shortcuts called heuristics. One of the most popular is the affect heuristic. An affect is a momentary judgment: something you like or dislike. The word “gunfire” triggers a negative effect. The word “luxury” produces a positive one. This automatic, one-dimensional impulse prevents you from considering risks and benefits to be independent variables, which indeed they are. Instead, the affect heuristic puts risks and benefits on the same sensory thread.

Unfortunately, introspection is, in large part, fabrication posing two dangers: First, the introspection illusion creates inaccurate predictions of future mental states. Trust your internal observations too much and too long, and you might be in for a very rude awakening. Second, we believe that our introspections are more reliable than those of others, which creates an illusion of superiority. Remedy: Be all the more critical with yourself. Regard your internal observations with the same skepticism as claims from some random person. Become your own toughest critic.

Inability to Close Doors

There is no such thing as a free option. In most other realms, however, options seem to be free. But this is an illusion. They also come at a price, but the price tag is often hidden and intangible: Each decision costs mental energy and eats up precious time for thinking and living. CEOs who examine every possible expansion option often choose none in the end. Companies that aim to address all customer segments end up addressing no one. Salespeople who chase every single lead close no deals. We are obsessed with having as many irons as possible in the fire, ruling nothing out, and being open to everything. However, this can easily destroy success. We must learn to close doors.

business strategy is primarily a statement on what not to engage in. Adopt a life strategy similar to a corporate strategy: Write down what not to pursue in your life. In other words, make calculated decisions to disregard certain possibilities and when an option shows up, test it against your not-to-pursue list.

When contemplating the future, we place far too much emphasis on flavor-of-the-month inventions and the latest “killer apps” while underestimating the role of traditional technology. In the 1960s, space travel was all the rage, so we imagined ourselves on school trips to Mars.

Taleb, who uses above-mentioned examples of new and old technologies, coined a word for this: neomania, the mania for all things shiny and new.

Sleeper Effect

Amazingly, just the opposite is true for propaganda. If it strikes a chord with someone, this influence will only increase over time. Why? Psychologist Carl Hovland, who led the study for the War Department, named this phenomenon the sleeper effect. To date, the best explanation is that, in our memories, the source of the argument fades faster than the argument. In other words, your brain quickly forgets where the information came from (e.g., from the Department of Propaganda). Meanwhile, the message itself (i.e., war is necessary and noble) fades only slowly or even endures <You have reached the clipping limit for this item>

Longevity expert and gerontologist Aubrey de Grey uses the metaphor of maintaining a house to explain this key concept. How long does a house last? The answer obviously depends on how well you take care of it. If you do nothing, the roof will spring a leak before long, water and the elements will invade, and eventually the house will disintegrate. But if you proactively take care of the structure, repair all damage, confront all dangers, and rebuild or renovate parts from time to time using new materials and technologies, the life of the house can essentially be extended without limit.

Whole foods are foods in their unprocessed state. Most food is far removed from this. Most grains are “polished,” a process that removes the grain’s outer coating, which contains selenium, an important antioxidant mineral; fiber; and other valuable nutrients. This processing is done primarily for convenience—longer shelf life and faster cooking time—but the loss in nutritional value is considerable.

To get an idea if you have (or are on the way toward) insulin resistance (and TMS), try the following at home right now: 1. Use a tape measure to measure the circumference of your abdomen right at the level of your belly button. More than 35 inches for women, or more than 40 inches for men, indicates a good chance of TMS. 2. Measure the circumference of your hips at their widest point. 3. Divide your waist measurement by your hip measurement. This waist/hip ratio is even more predictive of TMS than waist circumference alone. In women, the ratio should be less than 0.8 (hourglass); in men, it should be less than 1.0 (celery stick). If your ratio is higher than these benchmarks, have your doctor perform one of the tests described below.

The unique double-stranded structure of the DNA molecule allows it to unzip itself in places and reproduce perfect single-stranded copies of its complementary strands. In this fashion, genetic information contained within DNA is “transcribed” (copied) into single-stranded RNA “messenger” molecules. These RNA messenger molecules then “express” (convey) the DNA information to link the 20 amino acids found in the body together to form the proteins that make life possible. These proteins then carry out the daily functions of cellular life.

free radicals are highly unstable and must restore their paired electron status by getting hold of another electron immediately. They do so by stealing electrons from whatever molecules happen to be close by, damaging these other molecules and turning them into free radicals. If that molecule is DNA, the genetic blueprint for replication of all cells in the body, the damage will persist as the DNA replicates. This will cause cellular damage and increase the risk of cancer.

It consists of just three core principles: truth, love, and power. Four secondary principles are directly derived from the first three: oneness, authority, courage, and intelligence.

New situations shift your mind into learning mode, which enables you to discover new patterns. The more patterns your mind learns, the better it gets at prediction, and the smarter you become.

Gratitude journals, dream journals, food journals, workout journals, etc. You can write about your goals, dreams, plans, family, commitments, lessons learned, and anything else that you feel you need to focus on in your life. My journaling method ranges from being a very specific, structured process – listing what I’m grateful for, acknowledging my accomplishments, clarifying what areas I want to improve on, and planning which specific actions I’m committed to taking to improve – to being pretty traditional, just a dated entry with a synopsis of my day. I find both to be very valuable, and it’s nice to mix it up.

How Do Chemicals Make Us Happy? The feeling we call “happiness” comes from four special brain chemicals: dopamine, endorphin, oxytocin, and serotonin. These “happy chemicals” turn on when your brain sees something good for your survival. Then they turn off, so they’re ready to activate again when something good crosses your path. Each happy chemical triggers a different good feeling: Dopamine produces the joy of finding things that meet your needs—the “Eureka! I got it!” feeling. Endorphin produces oblivion that masks pain—often called euphoria. Oxytocin produces the feeling of being safe with others—now called bonding. Serotonin produces the feeling of being respected by others—pride. “I don’t define happiness

How Do Happy Chemicals Work? Happy chemicals are controlled by tiny brain structures that all mammals have in common: the hippocampus, amygdala, pituitary, hypothalamus, and other parts collectively known as the limbic system. The human limbic system is surrounded by a huge cortex. Your limbic system and cortex are always working together to keep you alive and keep your DNA alive. Each has its special job: Your cortex looks for patterns in the present that match patterns you connected in the past. Your limbic system releases neurochemicals that tell your body “this is good for you, go toward it,” and “this is bad for you, avoid it.” Your body doesn’t always act on these messages because your cortex can override them. If the cortex overrides a message, it generates an alternative and your limbic system reacts to it. So your cortex can inhibit your limbic system momentarily, but your mammal brain is the core of who you are. Your cortex directs attention and sifts information, but your limbic brain sparks the action.

How Can You Build New Pathways? When you were young, you built new circuits easily. In adulthood, building a new circuit is as hard as slashing through a dense rainforest. Every step requires huge effort, and the new trail you worked so hard for disappears into the undergrowth if you don’t use it again soon. All this slashing may feel like a waste of time when you already have a network of superhighways to use instead. Your neurons have difficulty sending electricity down a path you’ve never activated before. Each time a pathway is activated, it fires more easily. Repetition develops a neural trail slowly, the way a dirt path hardens from years of use. So how can you build new pathways? The answer is simple: Feed your brain new experiences again and again. Repetition will build the circuits you want. No one can build them for you, and you cannot build them for someone else. This book helps you select new experiences that stimulate happy chemicals, and repeat them until they surge with electricity. You can feel good in ways that are good for you.

Your Neural Guidance System The trails you have built thus far in your life combine to make up your neural guidance system. The system might not be what you’d design today if you started from scratch, but it guides your reactions to the situations you encounter on a daily basis. Your inner mammal has no reason to doubt its own reactions because they’re built from your actual life experiences. You don’t notice your neural guidance system because you built it without conscious intent. That’s why it’s hard to build new trails: You don’t know how you built the old ones.

Love is a huge surge of happy chemicals because it’s hugely relevant to the survival of your genes. You’re not thinking about your genes when you’re in love, but your genes are inherited from people who did what it took to reproduce successfully.

When endorphin was discovered, it was called endogenous morphine because it was so similar to opiates yet was produced by the body’s own endogenous systems. But it would be more true to say that morphine is the drug industry’s endorphin. Heroin and other opium derivatives have an effect on us because they fit our natural endorphin receptors.

We are not designed to release endorphin all the time. Exercise can give you a little, but exercising to the point of pain doesn’t promote survival. Laughing and crying trigger internal convulsions that stimulate endorphin, but this road to euphoria is limited too. Fake laughs don’t trigger the internal convulsions, and real laughs only last for seconds. Real cries are painful, and fake cries don’t trigger the physical distress.

Parental attachment revolutionized the biology of the brain. It became possible for mammals to be born without survival skills and to learn from life experience instead. Unlike reptiles, fish, and plants, which are born with all necessary survival knowledge, mammals are born fragile and stupid. The mammal brain does not fully develop in the safety of the uterus or egg. It develops by interacting with the world around it. A mammal needs protection while its brain is still developing, but this investment leads to a huge advantage: Each generation wires itself to survive in the world it actually lives in rather than the world of its ancestors.

The smaller an animal’s brain, the more it relies on prewired survival skills. That prewired brain is adapted to a specific ecological niche, and it quickly dies outside that niche. The bigger an animal’s brain, the more it builds survival skills from life experience. A big brain makes connections instead of being born with connections. The larger a creature’s brain, the longer it remains helpless after birth. It takes time to fill a brain with useful connections.

Each mammal species has gestures that signal dominance and submission. A dominance gesture signals the intent to control food or mating opportunity. A submission gesture protects an individual from the pain of conflict with stronger individuals. Animals only fight when both individuals believe they are stronger. Conflict is usually avoided because animals are skilled at assessing their relative strength, and the weaker individual submits to avoid harm.

When you were young, everything was new, so you often experienced things as “the best ever” or “the worst ever.” That caused a neurochemical surge big enough to wire in a circuit. But the next time you eat the same pizza, it’s not “the best you ever had.” The next time you suffer the same public humiliation, it’s not “the worst you’ve ever had.” Life often falls short of your expectations because you built those expectations when the information was new.

You were born with a lot of neurons but very few connections between them. Connections built as you interacted with the world around you, and they make you who you are. But you may want to remodel your circuits a bit. It seems like it should be easy because you built those circuits effortlessly in youth, but building new circuits in adulthood is surprisingly hard. Your old circuits are so efficient that avoiding them gives you the feeling that your survival is threatened. Any new circuits you build are flimsy by comparison. This is why change is difficult. It helps to know how a brain actually builds its wiring, and that’s what we’ll discuss in this chapter. When you can appreciate how difficult it is to create new pathways, you can celebrate your persistence instead of berating your progress.

BUILDING SYNAPSES WITHOUT EMOTION Synapses can build without neurochemicals, but it takes a lot of repetition. For example, you can learn romantic words in a foreign language quite quickly, but learning verb conjugations usually requires dreary repetition. Romance triggers neurochemicals that build synapses quickly, but repetition gives you the power to build any synapse you decide is important. If a synapse is activated many times, it gradually learns to transmit an electrochemical signal efficiently, even without extra rowboats in the fleet.

When a receptor is not used for a while, it disappears, which leaves space for any new receptors you may need. Flexibility is good, but it also means that you must use your happy receptors or lose them.

Focusing Your Attention on Survival Your attention is limited. If you invest it in one place, you have less to invest in alternatives. It takes little attention to follow a familiar path, but shifting to the unfamiliar makes heavy demands on your attention.

Remodeling Your Neural Pathways Most adults end up with some circuits they’d rather not have. And most people wish they could have more happy chemicals with fewer side effects. You cannot build new circuits in the effortless way it happened the first time. But you can build them with repetition and emotion.

Emotion is a Catch-22. Anything that feels good now will have side effects later. Good feelings exist because of their side effects, thanks to natural selection.

Repetition works slowly, but it can build behaviors with fewer side effects. If you expose yourself to something over and over, it can “grow on you.” You can come to like things that are good for you even though you don’t like them instantly. But who wants to repeat something over and over if it doesn’t feel good? Usually, people don’t, especially when they’re already feeling bad. This is why we rely on the circuits built by accidents of experience. Your accidents will shape you unless you start repeating things by choice. Alas, repetition can be harder than you expect.

Cry on Occasion Crying releases endorphin because of the physical exertion. I do not suggest making a habit of crying—it comes with a lot of cortisol too. But most adults habitually squelch the urge to cry, and that creates tension. Unsquelching relieves the tension. A few minutes of crying can relieve a bad feeling that you’ve squelched for years.

music gives pleasure because your mind keeps predicting what comes next. Each correct prediction triggers dopamine. You can’t make good predictions for unfamiliar music, so you don’t get the dopamine. But when music is too familiar, something strange happens. You don’t get the dopamine either because your brain predicts it effortlessly. To make you happy, music must be at the sweet spot of novelty and familiarity. The music that makes you happy today will eventually fail to make you happy, because it will become too familiar. At the same time, music that doesn’t make you happy today can make you happy in the future. If you want to stay happy, it seems you have to expose yourself to unfamiliar music now, so it will be in the sweet spot by the time you’ve worn out your old pleasures.

If you spread it everywhere, a new road may not get built. So choose one remodeling project to start with. Commit to repeating it for forty-five days whether or not you feel like it. If you miss a day, start over with Day One.

Balance Your brain wants all four of the happy chemicals. You are probably better at some than others, and it’s tempting to choose a remodeling project in the area you’re already good at. That may be good for your first circuit-building project, but after that, give your brain the happy chemical it is missing. You may have to enter unknown territory to do that, but the risk will bring great rewards.

For example: If you are already a “dopamine kind of person,” good at setting goals and meeting them, you could do more for yourself by working on a different happy chemical. If you are already an “oxytocin person,” good at social bonding, you’d get higher returns by investing your effort in a different area. If you’re a “serotonin person,” good at winning respect, you can flourish by developing other happy-chemical circuits. If you tend to be an “endorphin person,” drawn to mastering pain, you could benefit from focusing elsewhere.

Graft You can graft a new branch onto the roots of a happy circuit you’ve already developed. When old people reconnect with high-school sweethearts, they are grafting new circuits onto old roots. Returning to a hobby you loved as a child or building a hobby into a career are other well-known grafting successes. Adding branches to an existing tree is a good way to overcome the difficulty of building brand-new happy circuits.

Energy Your brain only has a limited amount of energy. You can enhance it with exercise, sleep, and good nutrition, but it will still be limited. New behaviors consume more energy than you expect. When you commit to a forty-five day rewiring project, you commit to making that energy available. If you run out of energy before meeting your daily commitment, you will find reasons to ditch it. So make your new habit the top-priority use of your energy for forty-five days, even if you have to relax another priority. One way to ensure energy is to schedule your new habit first thing in the morning.

Satisfice Our brains are good at finding satisfactory solutions, fast. Sometimes we regret them later as we imagine the ideal thing we coulda-woulda-shoulda done. The urge to make the most of life is natural, but if you’re always optimizing, you’re never happy. When I find it hard to stop optimizing, I remind myself that the 1978 Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to a mathematical proof that “satisficing” is better than optimizing. Herbert Simon showed us why embracing a satisfactory solution is better than investing in endless analysis.

Plan Build a new circuit before you need it. Try new vegetables before you get bored with the old ones. Do someone a favor before you need a favor from her. Develop new sources of pride before you retire and get wrinkles. You may feel too busy to do these things now, but once they trigger happy chemicals, you’ll be glad you did. Instead of waiting for happy chemicals to come your way, plan to “do something.” Planning is also a good way to relieve unhappy chemicals.

How far do you expect to go per day? 2. How fast do you cycle? 3. What is your daily budget? 4. Should we stay in hotels, campsites or try to wild camp for free? 5. How often do you want to take a rest day? 6. What time of the day do you like to get started? 7. If the weather turns nasty, do we ride through the storm or seek shelter and shorten the tour? 8. Do you want to cook meals together or apart? 9. What excites you about touring, and what do you think the most challenging part will be? 10. What would your ideal day on the road be like?

La CNV nous engage à reconsidérer la façon dont nous nous exprimons et dont nous entendons l’autre. Les mots ne sont plus des réactions routinières et automatiques, mais deviennent des réponses réfléchies, émanant d’une prise de conscience de nos perceptions, de nos émotions et de nos désirs. Nous nous exprimons alors sincèrement et clairement, en portant sur l’autre un regard empreint de respect et d’empathie. Dans tout échange, nous sommes à l’écoute de nos besoins les plus profonds et de ceux de l’autre. La CNV aiguise notre sens de l’observation et nous incite à identifier les comportements et les situations qui nous touchent. Nous apprenons aussi à définir et à formuler clairement ce que nous souhaitons dans une situation donnée. Pour élémentaire qu’elle paraisse, cette démarche est un puissant moyen de transformation.
